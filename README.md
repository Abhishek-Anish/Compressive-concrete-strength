This project aims to predict concrete compressive strength using various regression techniques. The analysis involves a comprehensive dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, comprising information about the compressive strength of concrete and the components used in the mixture. The research explores linear regression, lasso regression, and regression tree models to identify influential predictors and enhance our understanding of concrete strength.
The predictive models were evaluated based on Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared values. The results demonstrate varying performances among the predictive models. The linear regression model, employing stepwise search for minimum AIC, exhibited accuracy with an MSE of 83.71, RMSE of 9.14, and an R-squared value of 0.69. The lasso regression model showcased good predictive capabilities, yielding an MSE of 113.52, RMSE of 10.65, and an R-squared of 0.58. The regression tree model also delivered competitive results, displaying an MSE of 67.006 and an RMSE of 8.19. These findings offer valuable insights into the effectiveness of each model in predicting concrete compressive strength.
